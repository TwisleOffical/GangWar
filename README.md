#Gang War By Twisle


This is a client side FiveM script that will make it so when you go in the Ballas , Vagos, and/or Familes areas they will attack you no questions asked

This script is intended to make it so people dont go where they shouldnt go. You can also add some sort of mission along with this script to your own server!

#**Installation**

Put GangWar into you server resource folder.
then put 'ensure GangWar' into you server.cfg 


#**Turn It Off And On**

To turn a gang on and off go to the config.lua file and set it to false

false = off

true = on
